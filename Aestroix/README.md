THE FINAL PROJECT

_______________________________________________________________________

-> There are two files server.py and client.py and the game works like that:

The server file starts first and client waits for the turn of client and then client's turn come and vice versa.
This process repeats till one of the two wins or the game is draw. 

It may be noted that the board is individually maintained in both the server and the client file and the check for the result is carried out in server and client individually.


-> When the game ends either by someone winning or game being draw, then the instruction pop-up will come telling about the instructions which are:

==> Whether you want to play again. Pressing SPACE will do that.
==> You want to end the game. Pressing ESC can do that.




FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:

-> I have used a very beautiful image for the background and for X's and O's to plot on "mouseclick", it looks really awesome to look at :)
-> Secondly, I have implemented the play again feature with the same client. :)
